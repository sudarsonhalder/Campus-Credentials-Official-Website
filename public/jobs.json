    "linkedin_org_description": "EarnIn lets you access your money as you earn it — not days or weeks later.\n\nWe’re reimagining the way money moves to make financial momentum accessible to everyone. That starts with payday every day and builds with tools like credit monitoring, automated savings accounts, and low-balance protection. All with no interest, no credit checks, and no mandatory fees. So our customers have as many options as possible to save and spend on their terms.\n\nEarnIn’s pioneering Earned Wage Access app is backed by world-class partners like A16Z, Matrix Partners, and DST. Since our founding in 2013, 3.8 million customers have given it over 380,000 5-star reviews for helping them access over $15 billion in earnings. That means:\n\n- 49% can now cover an unexpected expense of $400 since using EarnIn\n- 73% can budget more effectively with EarnIn\n- 66% have been able to pay bills on time with EarnIn’s help\n\nWe’re proud of that impact. Because no one should feel stuck — held back from their ambitions, their life — simply because they can’t access the money they’ve already earned. That’s why EarnIn is here, to help people move forward with the lives they want today and the goals they have for tomorrow.\n\nJoin us.\n\nEarnIn is a financial technology company, not a bank. The Deposit Account, Secured Account, and EarnIn Card are issued by Evolve Bank & Trust, Member FDIC. The EarnIn Card is issued pursuant to a license from Visa USA Inc. ",
