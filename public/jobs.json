Founded in 2015 by a group of passionate engineers with expertise in robotics and defense engineering, our journey has been marked by innovation and impactful achievements.\n\nOur initial breakthrough came during our academic days with the development of a robotic powered exoskeleton. Since then, we have focused on refining our designs for commercial applications. Our latest achievement, the G2 (Generation two) model, is renowned as the lightest, most cost-effective, and powerful exoskeleton available in the industrialized world. It excels in tasks ranging from logistical support in combat operations to roles in construction, firefighting, and rescue missions.\n\nAs a socially conscious enterprise, we have made significant strides with \"Bandicoot,\" the world's first manhole cleaning robot. Designed with a human-controlled interface, Bandicoot has garnered international acclaim and is operational in 21 states with over 180 units, benefiting more than 3000 sanitation workers. We take pride in transforming the lives of manual scavengers and are committed to pioneering innovations that foster positive societal change.\n\nIn line with the Manual Scavenging Act of 2013 and efforts towards manual scavenging eradication, we believe in leveraging robotic solutions for sewer tank cleaning and sewage management. Manual scavenging, which violates fundamental rights, has been banned in India, and our robotic sewer solutions play a crucial role in ensuring safe and efficient sewage cleaning operations.\n\nAt GenRobotic, we remain dedicated to staying at the forefront of robotics and AI development. We collaborate closely with educational institutions to nurture aspiring young engineers and collectively develop solutions that promote overall societal well-being.",

    "linkedin_org_description": "Companies have spent over two decades building the equivalent of digital nervous systems for their businesses. These corporate nervous systems are being further extended by the continued growth of the internet. Corporate information systems have been built on both internal and external (cloud) technology using both custom built or purchased software. But after all this investment of capital and time, one of the core purposes of all this technology still alludes many companies which is to allow management to understand their competitive environment, monitor the company’s internal state and identify the critical areas that require focus. \r\n\r\nSome believe the answer lies in “big data,” others in the “internet of things” with the expanding reach of mobile technology and the list goes on. We at OneGlobe believe that more data by itself does not translate into the clarity that management seeks. It requires the right skills using the right data and the right tools to provide the useful insight management seeks and needs to remain competitive. And, as the amount of digital data increases further, the right people, data and tools becomes more of a corporate imperative to help bring clarity.\r\n\r\nOneGlobe was formed with this vision in mind. We are a service and consulting company specializing in the area of better corporate management through the effective use of Oracle tools. We provide a range of Oracle related services but our core areas of focus and where we excel are:\r\n\r\n> Oracle SaaS Implementations covering ERP, EPM, Risk Management & HCM Applications\r\n> Business Analytics covering Hyperion, Big Data & IoT Applications & Technology\r\n> Oracle PaaS enabled Integration Services\r\n> Oracle Cloud Managed Services\r\n\r\nOur goal is to focus on those things we know best and help companies make meaningful changes that will grow their top and bottom lines.
