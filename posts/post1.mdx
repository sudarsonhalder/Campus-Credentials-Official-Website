### Sample Interview Questions

#### Technical Questions
```python
# Example: Reverse a string in Python

def reverse_string(s):
    return s[::-1]

# Test the function
print(reverse_string("Interview"))  # Output: weivretnI
```

#### Aptitude Questions
**Question:** If a train travels 60 km in 1 hour, how long will it take to cover 180 km?

**Solution:**
```math
\text{Speed} = 60 \text{ km/h}
\text{Distance} = 180 \text{ km}
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{180}{60} = \textbf{3 hours}
```

#### Behavioral Questions
**Question:** Describe a challenging project you worked on and how you handled it.

**Tips for Answering:**
- Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result).
- Focus on your role and contributions.

### Preparation Guide for Top Companies

#### Google
- **Key Focus Areas:** Data structures, algorithms, system design.
- **Example Question:** Implement a binary tree traversal algorithm.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def inorder_traversal(root):
    if root:
        inorder_traversal(root.left)
        print(root.value, end=' ')
        inorder_traversal(root.right)

# Example Usage
root = Node(1)
root.left = Node(2)
root.right = Node(3)
inorder_traversal(root)  # Output: 2 1 3
```

#### Amazon
- **Key Focus Areas:** Problem-solving, leadership principles.
- **Example Question:** Solve the two-sum problem.

```python
# Two-sum problem in Python

def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i

# Example
print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

#### TCS
- **Key Focus Areas:** Aptitude, logical reasoning, and technical basics.
- **Example Question:** Solve a quadratic equation.
